# Object-Oriented Programming
> ## What is Object-Oriented Programming ? aka OOP
>   * ["A programming paradigm which provide a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviours are bundled into individual objects"](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) -realpython.com
>   * One of the more common programming paradigms 
>       * [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) is another common paradigm 
>   * The majority of code use several programing paradigms

>## Object
>| Components of an Object         | Description   | Example         |
>|---------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
>| attribute                       | <ul><li>describes the object </li><li> aka properties or arguments </li></ul>| <ul><li> name </li><li> age </li>   <li> gender </li></ul>|
>| behavior                        | <ul><li>An action taken by the object</li><li>function or method</li></ul>    | <ul><li> run </li><li> walk </li>   <li> jump </li></ul>|

>## Class
   > - A Class is a set of blueprints to create an instance of an Object
   >    - User defined data structures 
   > - Example of a Class
   >
   > - A **Vehicle** class is the blueprint used to create a vehicle object.
   >    - The Vehicle class provide the stucture needed to create a vehicle object
   >    - The Vehicle class is not a vehicle, it's just a blueprint of what attributes a vehicle should have
   > - **ScottsCar** is an object
   >    - It is an instance of the Vehicle class
   >    - ScottsCar has specific attributes that describe it
   >    - If another object has the same attribute it doesn't mean that the objects are the same
